Things left to do

1. TODO: Evaluate if moving to PostCSS makes more sense than keeping everything in sass and make a mess of things.Change the layouts so they use grid instead of floats
2. Do something with the footer, maybe break it into flexbox
   or do multicolumn to make sure that different widgets
   stay in place. We also need to figure out how to
   automate the process for placement
3. Fix the header and add something more than what's there
   * play with width and item placement
* Add Screenshot
* Add License files for font, ffo and Prism
